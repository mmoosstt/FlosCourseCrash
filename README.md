# FlosCourseCrash
python crash course

This project was started with the following thesis:

domain knowledge is more important than programming knowledge - DKOPK (Domain knowledge over programming knowledge)

Patient zero was found, in the further context called FLO. The overall goal is to enable FLO. 

Therefore FLO stop talking and start with

## installing an IDE ##
* eclipse/pydev
* python 
* git

![SET_UP_IDE](./doc/SET_UP_IDE.md "Setting Up the ide")

and then FLO progresses with the 

## first pydev projekt ###
TBD

that was straigt forword and cool so we now have to dive into

## open source development with git ##
TBD

and so on FLO
